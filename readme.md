# Check Parallel Tool
A simple tool to check & visualize if the line connecting handles and the line connecting on-curve points are parallel.

Inspired by the **What I learned from Rod Cavazos** section of OHno Type Co's ["Drawing Vectors for Type & Lettering"](https://ohnotype.co/blog/drawing-vectors)

Double-click on the canvas to set tool accuracy. This tool reads and writes a text file for data persistence.

### To do
- Maybe use angle instead of slope?
- Some sort of gradated color scheme, so it's less "right" vs. "wrong"
- Compare multiple segments (ie. see if parallel segments are really parallel)
