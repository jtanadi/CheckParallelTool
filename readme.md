# Check Parallel Tool
A simple tool to check & visualize if the line connecting handles and the line connecting on-curve points are parallel.

Currently there's some tolerance between the 2 lines (ie. they don't have to be 100% parallel), but the value is arbitrary. Maybe this value is something a user can manipulate (double-click to bring up a window with slider?).

Inspired by the **What I learned from Rod Cavazos** section of OHno Type Co's ["Drawing Vectors for Type & Lettering"](https://ohnotype.co/blog/drawing-vectors)
