# Check Parallel Tool
A simple tool to check & visualize if the line connecting handles and the line connecting on-curve points are parallel. 

Inspired by the **What I learned from Rod Cavazos** section of OHno Type Co's ["Drawing Vectors for Type & Lettering"](https://ohnotype.co/blog/drawing-vectors)
