# Check Parallel Tool
A tool to check if the line connecting BCPs & oncurves are parallel, as well as edit BCPs by manipulating connection lines.

The extension draws guidelines and installs its own editing tool.

## How to use
Guides are toggled on/off by pressing the "/" key and can be used with any tool (EditingTool, ScalingEditTool, etc.). Guide visibility is shown at the bottom right corner of the glyph window.

Similar to other Tunni tools, the Edit Connection Line Tool allows users to edit BCPs by manipulating the line between them.

With the tool on, double-click on the canvas to set tool accuracy. This tool reads and writes a text file for data persistence.

## ðŸ“£
Inspired by the **What I learned from Rod Cavazos** section of OHno Type Co's ["Drawing Vectors for Type & Lettering"](https://ohnotype.co/blog/drawing-vectors).

H/t to [Stephen Nixon](http://stephennixon.com/) for the "guides-only" idea. 
As always, thanks to [Frederik Berlaen](http://typemytype.com/) and [Gustavo Ferreira](http://www.gustavoferreira.com/) for all the Robohelp!

### To do / other ideas
- Some sort of gradated color scheme, so it's less "right" vs. "wrong"
- Compare multiple segments (ie. see if parallel segments are really parallel)
